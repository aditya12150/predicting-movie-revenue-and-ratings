# Predicting Box Office Revenue and Audience Ratings Using Supervised Learning

This project uses supervised machine learning models to predict two key outcomes for movies: 
- Box office revenue (regression)
- Audience success (classification: High/Low based on IMDb score)

## Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

## Dataset
- IMDb movie metadata (5,043 movies, 28 features)

## Key Features
- Budget, duration, vote count, critic reviews, and "star power" (total Facebook likes)

## Results
- Random Forest Regressor R² ≈ 0.67
- Random Forest Classifier Accuracy ≈ 80%, F1 ≈ 0.67
